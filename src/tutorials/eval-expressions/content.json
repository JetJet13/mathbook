For completeness, we are going to evaluate two different kinds of expressions.\n\nLet's start with an expression without variables.\n$$5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1$$\nWhen evaluating an expression with no variables, we can simply evaluate by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &= 5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 5 + 4\\times 8 - 1 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 5 + 32 - 1 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 37 - 1 &&\\text{Subtraction}\\\\\n&= 36 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nGood stuff. Now let's evaluate an expression with variables.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &&\\text{at $x = 3$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe have to perform an additional step at the start before we can evaluate, which is to substitute the value given for the variable, in this case \\(3\\) for \\(x\\). \n\nThen evaluate like a simple expression by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &= (3)^2 - 5(3) + 8 && \\text{substitute in 3 wherever you see $x$}\\\\\n&= 3^2 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 9 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 9 - 15 + 8 &&\\text{Subtraction (since it comes before Addition)}\\\\\n&= -6 + 8 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 2 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThat's it! Now you know how to evaluate an expression. Practice these concepts in the Exercise section below."
