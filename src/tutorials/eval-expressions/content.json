For completeness, we are going to evaluate two different kinds of expressions.\n\nLet's start with an expression without variables.\n$$5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1$$\nWhen evaluating an expression with no variables, we can simply evaluate by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &= 5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 5 + 4\\times 8 - 1 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 5 + 32 - 1 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 37 - 1 &&\\text{Subtraction}\\\\\n&= 36 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nGood stuff. Now let's evaluate an expression with variables.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &&\\text{at $x = 3$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe have to perform an additional step at the start before we can evaluate, which is to substitute the value given for the variable, in this case \\(3\\) for \\(x\\). \n\nThen evaluate like a simple expression by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &= (3)^2 - 5(3) + 8 && \\text{substitute in 3 wherever you see $x$}\\\\\n&= 3^2 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 9 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 9 - 15 + 8 &&\\text{Subtraction (since it comes before Addition)}\\\\\n&= -6 + 8 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 2 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThat's it!

        "text": "Now that we've gone over some examples of expressions and we learned how to evaluate them, let's finish this tutorial off by discussing the value of knowing how to evaluate expressions.\n\nTo start, it's fair to say that if we were given an expression without context of what it represents, then we wouldn't really learn very much by evaluating it, besides how to evaluate it of course. \n\nHowever, if I was to give you an equation (which is simply a combination of terms and expressions), say \\(M = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh\\) which is the equation of finding the mechanical energy of an object with mass \\(m\\), velocity \\(v\\) and height \\(h\\). By simply evaluating the expresssion:  \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh\\) we could determine the amount of mechanical energy relative to that object.\n\nLet's apply everything we just learned into finding the mechanical energy of a  bowling ball rolling down a bowling alley.\n\n$$\\text{Suppose we were given a bowling ball that has a mass $m = 4$kg}$$\n$$\\text{Find the amount of mechanical energy present when we roll the bowling ball down the alley at a velocity of 4m/s.}$$\nTo start, let's define the values for our variables\n\n\\(\n\\begin{aligned}\nm &= 4~\\text{kg}\\\\\nv &= 4~\\text{m/s}\\\\\ng &= 9.8~\\text{m/s} && \\text{$g$ represents the gravitational constant}\\\\\nh &= 0~\\text{m} && \\text{h represents the height/distance of the bowling ball relative to the ground/bowling alley}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\)\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM &= \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh && \\text{substitute in our values for $m,v,g$ and $h$}\\\\\nM &= \\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)^2 + (4)(9.8)(0) && \\text{}\\\\\nM &= 2\\cdot 16 + 0\\\\\nM &= 32~\\text{J} && \\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo what we learned by evaluating the expression was that the amount of mechanical energy that is present when rolling a bowling ball that weighs \\(4~\\text{kg}\\) down a bowling alley at a velocity of \\(4~\\text{m/s}\\) is 32 Joules (J).\n\n",
