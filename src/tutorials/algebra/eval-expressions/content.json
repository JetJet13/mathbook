      "In order to understand expressions, we have to break the expressions down into their terms.\n\nA term is a group of constants (numbers) and variables (like \\(x\\)) combined together with various operators like \\(\\times\\) and \\(\\div\\).\n\nAn expression is a set of terms that are joined together by binary operators \\(+\\) and \\(-\\).\n\nHere are a few examples of terms and expressions.\n\n<div class=\"columns\">\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><strong>Terms</strong></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(4x\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(12\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(y^2\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)</span></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"columns\">\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><strong>Expressions</strong></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(4 + x\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(6 - k\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(y - x^2\\)</span></div>\n  <div class=\"column has-text-centered\"><span>\\(6x-2y\\)</span></div>\n</div>\n\n"

      "Now for the fun part. For completeness, we are going to evaluate two different kinds of expressions.\n\nLet's start with an expression without variables.\n$$5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1$$\nWhen evaluating an expression with no variables, we can simply evaluate by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &= 5 + 4\\times 2^3 - 1 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 5 + 4\\times 8 - 1 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 5 + 32 - 1 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 37 - 1 &&\\text{Subtraction}\\\\\n&= 36 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nGood stuff. Now let's evaluate an expression with variables.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &&\\text{at $x = 3$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe have to perform an additional step at the start before we can evaluate, which is to substitute the value given for the variable, in this case \\(3\\) for \\(x\\). \n\nThen evaluate like a simple expression by applying BEDMAS.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 5x + 8 &= (3)^2 - 5(3) + 8 && \\text{substitute in 3 wherever you see $x$}\\\\\n&= 3^2 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Exponent}\\\\\n&= 9 - 5 \\times 3 + 8 &&\\text{Multiplication}\\\\\n&= 9 - 15 + 8 &&\\text{Subtraction (since it comes before Addition)}\\\\\n&= -6 + 8 &&\\text{Addition}\\\\\n&= 2 &&\\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThat's it! Now you know how to evaluate an expression. The next section will explain how we can evaluate expressions to learn about the world around us."

      "Now that we've gone over some examples of expressions and we learned how to evaluate them, let's finish this tutorial off by discussing the value of knowing how to evaluate expressions.\n\nSuppose we were given the equation, \\(M = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh\\), and we were told that evaluating the expression:  \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh\\) will tell us the amount of mechanical energy present in a physical system. Depending on who you are and what you're interested in, figuring out that information might be important to you and knowing how to evaluate an expression will help you figure it out.\n\nTo help get the point across, let's do an example and find the mechanical energy of a bowling ball rolling down a bowling alley.\n\n$$\\text{Suppose we were given a bowling ball that has a mass $m = 4~$kg}$$\n$$\\text{Find the amount of mechanical energy present when we roll the bowling ball down the alley at a velocity of 4m/s.}$$\nTo start, let's define the values for our variables:\n $$m = 4~\\text{kg} \\quad v = 4~\\text{m/s} \\quad g = 9.8~\\text{m/s} \\quad h = 0~\\text{m}$$\n<div class=\"columns is-centered\">\n<div class=\"column is-6\">\n<div class=\"message is-info\" style=\"white-space:normal;\">\n  <div class=\"message-header\">Note</div>\n  <div class=\"message-body has-text-centered\">\n    \\(g =\\) the gravitational constant for Earth.\n</br/>\n<br/>\n\\(h =\\)  the height/distance of the bowling ball relative to the ground/bowling alley.\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM &= \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh && \\text{substitute in our values for $m,v,g$ and $h$}\\\\\nM &= \\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)^2 + (4)(9.8)(0) && \\text{}\\\\\nM &= 2\\cdot 16 + 0\\\\\nM &= 32~\\text{J} && \\text{$\\square$}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhat we just learned by evaluating the expression was that the amount of mechanical energy that is present when rolling a bowling ball that weighs \\(4~\\text{kg}\\) down a bowling alley at a velocity of \\(4~\\text{m/s}\\) is 32 Joules (J).",
