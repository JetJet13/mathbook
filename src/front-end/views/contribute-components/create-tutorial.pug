            h3#gettingStarted Getting Started
            p Thanks for showing interest in creating a tutorial for Mathbook. Tutorials are at the heart of everything we want to accomplish with Mathbook.
            p To start, let's first discuss the idea behind Mathbook which in turn will help us define the purpose of our tutorials.
            p
              | The idea behind Mathbook is a very simple one, which is 
              | to provide the world a free online resource to learn the 
              strong What
              |, 
              strong Why
              |, and 
              strong How 
              | for all things Mathematics.
            
            p We can apply this idea to the tutorials we create by answering a few questions from the perspective of the reader,
              ul
                li What are you trying to explain ?
                li Why is it important ?
                li How do I do it ?

            p Please be sure that your tutorial addresses these three questions because we feel that answering these questions 
              | goes a long way to help the reader learn and understand the topic being discussed.

            h3#know Things to Know
            p In order to start building a tutorial, there are a few things you will need,
              ul
                li a GitHub account (you will need to 
                  a(href="https://github.com" target="_blank") create
                  |  one if you don't already have one)
                li some knowledge of 
                  a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX" target="_blank") TeX
                li basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (for formatting purposes)
              strong Note
              | : If you don't know much about TeX or HTML and CSS, don't worry about it too much, you can easily learn as you start building out the tutorial.
            p If you want to write a tutorial for a subject that is not listed in Mathbook, feel free to create an issue about it 
              a(href="https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/issues" target="_blank") here
              |  and a contributor will try their best to get it added in a timely manner.
            p When your tutorial gets approved and added to Mathbook, you will be added as a contributor (if you aren't one already).
            p The next section will talk about the different components that make up a tutorial.

            h3#components Tutorial Components
            p A Mathbook tutorial is composed of three components.
            ul
              li
                a(href='#config') Configuration
              li
                a(href='#content') Content
              li 
                a(href='#exercises') Exercises
            p Every tutorial follows a certain structure so that the reader can expect a certain format for each tutorial regardless of subject.
            h5#config Configuration
            p The configuration component contains basic information and metadata for the tutorial. In order for a tutorial to be considered complete and ready for submission, 
              | the configuration component must be completed in full i.e.) no empty data fields.
              br
              | Here's the full list of required data.
            ul
              li 
                strong Subject 
                span - the subject that the tutorial belongs to
              li 
                strong Title 
                span - the title of the tutorial
              li 
                strong Opening Statement 
                span - an opening statement for the tutorial 
              li 
                strong Prerequisite Topics 
                span - a list of pre-requisite topics that the reader should know before starting
              li 
                strong Exercises' Statement 
                span - a statement regarding the set of exercises presented at the end of the tutorial
              li 
                strong Resources 
                span - A list of external resources related to the topic discussed in the tutorial
              li 
                strong Keywords 
                span - a list of words that relate to the topic of the tutorial

            h5#cont Content
            p The content of the tutorial is simply all the sections (the body) of the tutorial that are not a part of the configuration and exercises. Each section can contain blocks of TeX that require rendering. For example,
            pre 
              code
                | &lt;p&gt; Here's an example for finding the roots of a polynomial. &lt;/p&gt;
                | $$ \text{Find the roots for} \quad y = x^2 - 4 $$
                | $$
                | \begin{aligned}
                | y &= x^2 - 4 \\
                | y &= (x - 2)(x + 2) \\
                | x &= \pm 2 \quad \text{$\square$}
                | \end{aligned}
                | $$
            p Will render into
            #mathSample.box
              p Here's an example for finding the roots of a polynomial.
                | $$ \text{Find the roots for} \quad y = x^2 - 4 $$
                | $$
                | \begin{aligned}
                | y &= x^2 - 4 \\
                | y &= (x - 2)(x + 2) \\
                | x &= \pm 2 \quad \text{$\square$}
                | \end{aligned}
                | $$
            h5#exercises Exercises
            p The last component of a tutorial are the exercises. 
              | At the end of each tutorial, you will need to provide some exercises (at least 3) 
              | so that the reader can apply and practice what was explained in the tutorial. One requirement
              | of the exercises is that they must increase in difficulty and they must be accompanied by answers.
              | Feel free to include small hints if you think they help the reader start off on the right track.
            p 
              strong Note
              | : The exercises cannot be links to an external site, they must live on the page of the tutorial.
            h3#publishing Publishing Tutorials
            p 
              | Once you have provided the required configuration information, content and exercises for your tutorial, and you feel
              | that your tutorial is complete and ready to be submitted, you can then submit the tutorial for review. 
              | Submitting the tutorial requires you to navigate to the tutorial dashboard and hitting the send icon for the tutorial 
              | you want to submit. It will then open a modal and you will be asked to provide a description (it's optional).
            p  
              | Once you submit, 
              | the tutorial needs to be reviewed by a fellow Mathbook contributor and approved.
              | Changes may be requested and discussed so having a github account is necessary for this process.
            p Once your tutorial gets approved and merged, it gets added to the collection of tutorials on Mathbook and 
              | your github account and name will be added to the contributors list.
            p You can take a look at the tutorials currently submitted for review
              a(href='https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/pulls' target="_blank")  here
            h3#start Start building your tutorial
            p For your convenience, here is a list of resources that we think will come in handy when you are creating your tutorial.
              ul

                  a(href="https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/function-support.html" target="_blank") Katex - Function Support
